Task: Divide given set of natural numbers into two sets the way that makes sum of numbers in two sets as close to each other as possible.

Example #1:
  * Given set: {5, 30, 10, 20, 5, 10, 15, 6, 8}
  * Result sets:
      1.  {30, 10, 6, 8}; SUM = 30 + 10 + 6 + 8 = 54
      2.  {5, 20, 5, 10, 15}; SUM = 5 + 20 + 5 + 10 + 15 = 55
      
Example #2:
  * Given set: {217, 101, 143, 149, 139, 261, 225, 222, 239, 182}
  * Result sets:
      1.  {217, 222, 261, 239}; SUM = 217 + 222 + 261 + 239 = 939
      2.  {225, 101, 149, 182, 139, 143}; SUM = 225 + 101 + 149 + 182 + 139 + 143 = 939
